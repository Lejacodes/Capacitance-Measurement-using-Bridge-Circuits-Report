# Capacitance Measurement using Bridge Circuits Report
My second report of the electronics course. This project focuses on: Capacitance Measurement using Bridge Circuits, where we have built circuits to measure unknown capacitances and phase differences using an oscilloscope, achieving accurate results by comparing with theory.
